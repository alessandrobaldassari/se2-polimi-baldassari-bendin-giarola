	- row 503, 504 the code could have been broken in three lines instead of two. The same can be, more or less, applied to other line facing the same problem.
	- row 516 even if the code exceeds the length of 80 chars by 2, the line can stay as is.
	
14.
	- all the lines that correctly exceeds 80 chars, never exceeds 120 chars.
	
15.
	- row 503 is wrong written because the line break preceeds the "+" operator
