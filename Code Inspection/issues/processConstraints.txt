2.
	- row 509-534 variable "m" in the while loop is used correctly.
	- row 536-552, 563-571 variable "e" in the if statement is used correctly.
	- row 540-544, 547-551, 565-569 variable "p" in the while loop is used correctly.
	
8.
	- three and four space are used in an inconsistent way, like in row 490 and 491.

9.
	- tabs are used like in row 488, also sometimes mixed with spaces, like in row 489.
	
10.
	- row 487 open the method using the "Allman" style, all other blocks follows the "Kernighan and Ritchie" style.
	
11.
	- row 488, 502, 509, 511, 536, 540, 547, 558, 563, 565, 574 --> OK

13.
	- row 503, 504 the code could have been broken in three lines instead of two. The same can be, more or less, applied to other line facing the same problem.
	- row 516 even if the code exceeds the length of 80 chars by 2, the line can stay as is.
	
14.
	- all the lines that correctly exceeds 80 chars, never exceeds 120 chars.
	
15.
	- row 503 is wrong written because the line break preceeds the "+" operator
	
17.
	- row 488, the block itself follows the specification, but it should have been indented by one more level
	- row 541, one level of indention is missing
