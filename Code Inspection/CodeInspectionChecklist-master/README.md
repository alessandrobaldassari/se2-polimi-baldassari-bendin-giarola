# Java code inspection checklist

LaTeX version of [original file](./original.pdf).

Mind that `enumitem` and `url` packages, imported at the beginning of the document, are fundamental for the whole thing to work (in particular, the former allows the `[resume]` option for `enumerate` environment, the latter typesets the URL at point 44).

This LaTeX document is far from perfect, but it works. If you spot any error, please let me know.

## Structure

+ **[`original.pdf`](./original.pdf)**, as already mentioned, is the original file, of which we created the LaTeX version;
+ **[`document.tex`](./document.tex)** is the central TeX file (remember that is contains also the two important packages);
+ **[`checklist.tex`](./checklist.tex)** contains the body of the document (as such, you can simply copy and paste it in your project);
+ **[`document.pdf`](./document.pdf)** is the result of our work.
